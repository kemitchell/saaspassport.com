SaaS Passport provides a toolkit of standardized legal documents anyone can use to build contract terms for software-as-a-service.

Offering software as a service with SaaS Passport terms enables businesspeople and lawyers alike to focus on the terms that matter for the deal, with a common baseline and vocabulary for terms that show up in every deal.

A deal on SaaS Passport terms is built of a few documents:

-  an <dfn>order form</dfn> listing deal-specific terms, for negotiation by businesspeople

-  a <dfn>rider</dfn> adding vendor-specific terms and optionally incorporating one or more <dfn>add-ons</dfn>, for negotiation by lawyers

-  <dfn>base terms</dfn>, fixed across vendors and deals, setting a standard baseline

SaaS Passport includes a number of add-ons, from business-focused add-ons like uptime service-level-agreements and support commitments to legal-focused terms like arbitration provisions and extended patent indemnification.
