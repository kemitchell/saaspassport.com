{{name}} is a [flipped form](https://flippedform.com) in everyday English. If some part of it doesn't make sense to you, that's the terms' fault, not yours.

_Everyone_ is welcome to share corrections, comments, and ideas for improvement [by e-mail](mailto:{{email}}). We're especially grateful for thoughts from users who _aren't_ lawyers, but welcome comments from legal colleagues, too.

{{name}} is a young project. But we're very interested in showing how we appreciate contributors.  Some may like [public thanks](/thanks). Some may like discounts and coupons. Some may like to bill us, or to talk about longer-term involvement on the business side. Some may just like a better {{name}}. Let us know.
