description: terms for access to and use of SaaS Passport
---

<mark>To access {{name}}, you have to agree to these terms with [Artless Devices LLC](https://artlessdevices.com/). Please read them. We've worked hard to keep them short.</mark>

### Fees

***If you use SaaS Passport terms to close a deal with a customer, you owe us our published fee. Pay via [saaspassport.com/pay](https://saaspassport.com/pay) within two business days of closing.  Pay for each deal you close with our terms.***

<details markdown="1">
This isn't a donation. It isn't a [tip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratuity). You owe us the money. That is our deal. But practically speaking, you are [on your honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_system). We're not going to lock down our terms, cripple them with [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management), or surveil our customers like secret police. We're going to make you click "Agree", and then we're going to trust you.

Our fee applies whether you close a deal on our terms verbatim, use our terms and make changes, or copy big chunks of our terms into your own. If you learn things from reading our terms, you obviously don't owe us any money for using what you learned. If you write your own, new terms partly inspired by ours, Godspeed. It's what we did.
</details>

### As Is

***Nobody involved bringing {{name}} to you will be liable to you for any damages related to {{name}}, for any kind of legal claim. {{name}} comes strictly ["as is"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_is). We don't make any guarantee that our terms are high quality or will work well for you. We don't guarantee our website will always stay up or have no [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug).***

<details markdown="1">
We're selling forms here, [not any kind of attorney-client relationship](https://notlegaladvice.law). Even if you reach out to us with [feedback](/contribute) or [questions](/contact), we won't be responsible to you as a lawyer would. We do recommend you hire a good lawyer, even just to make sure {{name}} fits your business. We know too many of you can't.
</details>

### Copies

We give you permission to make copies of {{name}} terms to review, learn, teach, negotiate, and keep records of your deals. You can share copies with others. But you have to follow a few simple rules.

<details markdown="1">
If you make changes to {{name}} terms, other than just to fill them out as directed, clarify that your terms aren't the same as {{name}} anymore. If you can add a note that your terms are "based on {{name}}" or "derived from {{name}}" where readers will be likely to see and notice, do so. Otherwise, remove all mention of "{{name}}" and "{{website}}" from your copy.

Don't remove any of our notes about copyrights, trademarks, licenses, or other legal terms that apply to our work. Where our terms go, those notes must go.

Don't republish our terms, especially on the open Internet. People who want our terms should come to {{website}}, not try an end run around these terms by accessing copies you posted elsewhere. Don't share our terms with anyone privately who you believe plans to use without paying us.
</details>

### California

If we somehow end up suing each out about anything related to {{name}}, we agree to take it to federal or state court in [Oakland, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California). California law will govern.

<details markdown="1">
We know you're not all in Oakland. But we can't really know what these terms mean, or whether they'll work, without pinning down what law applies. There are also a lot of you, everywhere, and just one of us. If you could sue us in a thousand different places, we could end up spending all our precious closing fees on plane tickets, lawyers, and translators. And then some.
</details>

### Changes

This version of our terms replaces any earlier version you may have agreed to. If we update these terms again, you will need to agree to them in order to keep accessing and using {{name}}.

### Side Deals

If your use of {{name}} is covered by another, separate deal with Artless Devices, that deal, not these terms, govern your use.  For example, if your company has a deal for use of {{name}} on a flat fee per month, you don't have to pay our published fee under these terms.

### The End

These are all the terms of our deal about {{name}}.  Thanks for reading.
