description: terms for access to and use of SaaS Passport
---

<mark>To access {{name}}, you have to agree to these terms with Artless Devices LLC. Please read them. We've worked hard to keep them short.</mark>

### Fees

***If you use SaaS Passport terms to close a deal with a customer, you owe us our published flat fee. Pay via [saaspassport.com/pay](https://saaspassport.com/pay) within two business days of closing.  Pay for each deal you close with our terms.***

This isn't a donation. It isn't a [tip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratuity). You owe us the money. That is our deal. But practically speaking, you are [on your honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_system). We're not going to lock down our terms, cripple them with [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management), or surveil our customers like secret police. We're going to make you click "Agree" first, and then we're going to trust you.

Our fee applies whether you close a deal on our terms verbatim, use our terms as a starting point and make changes, or copy big chunks of our terms into your own. If you learn things from reading our terms, you obviously don't owe us any money for using them later. If you write your own, new terms partly inspired by ours, Godspeed. It's what we did.

### As Is

***{{name}} terms come strictly "as is". We don't make any guarantee that they're high quality or will work well for you. What you see is what you get.  Nobody involved in bringing {{name}} to you will be liable to you for any damages related to {{name}} or this website, for any kind of legal claim.***

We're selling forms here, [not any kind of attorney-client relationship](https://notlegaladvice.law). Even if you reach out to us with [feedback](/contribute) or [questions](mailto:{{email}}), we won't be responsible to you as a lawyer would. We do recommend you hire a good lawyer, even just to make sure {{name}} fits your business. But we know many of you can't. If lawyers were as cheap as forms, maybe more of you would.

### Copies

***We give you permission to make copies of {{name}} terms and documents. But you have to follow a few simple rules.***

If you make changes to {{name}} terms, other than just to fill them out as directed, make more changes to clarify that your terms aren't the same as {{name}} terms anymore. Ideally, remove all mention of "{{name}}" and {{website}} from your copy. If you're sure you can be clear about it, you can also clarify that your terms are "based on {{name}}" or "derived from {{name}}".

Don't remove any of our notices about copyright ownership, trademarks, licenses, or other legal terms that apply to our work.

### California

***If we somehow end up suing each out about anything related to {{name}}, we agree to take it to federal or state court in [Oakland, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California). California law will govern.***

We know you're not all in California. But we can't really know what these terms mean, or whether they'll work, without pinning down what law applies. There are also a lot of you to just one of us. If a thousand people could sue us in a thousand different places, we'd end up spending all our closing fees on plane, lawyers, and translators. And then some.

### The End

These are all the terms of our deal about {{name}}.  Thanks for reading.
